Your route
localhost:8083/export/{userId}
# In the above URL we have to pass the user id to generate the CSV report for specific user.

How to run any additional scripts or tests you may have added
No additional scripts are required, Just need to load the above URL in browser to download the specific user CSV report.
  
How might you make this service more secure?
 To control access to API resources, you must carefully and comprehensively identify all related users and devices. This typically requires client-side applications to include a token in the API call so that the service can validate the client.
 
How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
 Vertical partition. Adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc.) to the database server. It has a hard limit.
 Horizontal partition by adding more database servers.
 Adding a caching layer to offload read requests.
 Now we can modularize the functions into different services. The architecture becomes service-oriented / microservice

What else would you have liked to improve given more time?
 writing test cases using jest, creating api documentation using swagger.
